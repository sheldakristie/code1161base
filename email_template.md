# What is this?

It's a template email for you to use so that your issues get dealt with quickly and with minimal back-and-forth. Filling it in carefully will make it so much easier for me to get through lots of emails while still giving each of them the attention it deserves.

Another way to think about this is that if you _don't_ fill it in well then you are stealing time away from your peers, and that's not very cool.

Copy this template, modify it so that it fits your situation, paste it into your email and off you go. Because it's in your repo, there are some things that you can change permanently to save time. E.g. your name will be the same, your repo will be the same etc.

Make sure that the template is carefully filled in, and you spell check it. This isn't because I'm some sort of grammar ogre, it just signals to me that you care about my time enough to communicate clearly with me. This will make me well disposed to do the same for you.

I assume, from your baldy head, that you have had an on-fire head before, what did you do about it?

Hi Ben,

Here's a polite, spell checked message to go with the information given above.

There shouldn't be _too_ much information here because it'll be mostly covered already.

Thanks

[your name]
